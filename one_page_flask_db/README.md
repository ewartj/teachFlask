inspired by:
- We've taken the "Hello world" app and improved the structure:
    - this follows the one page URL but instead of sending "Hello world" to the screen we're showing a simple sqlite database (test.db)
    - jinja 2 is used in the HTML to loop over the database and display each row as a row of a table in the URL
